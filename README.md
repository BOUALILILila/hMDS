# hMDS: Hyperbolic Multidimensional Scaling
A simple Python implementation for producing hyperbolic embedding using the hMDS algorithm proposed in [Representation Tradeoffs for Hyperbolic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03329.pdf).

Given the oberved pairwise distances arising from a set of points in hyperbolic space, the goal of hMDS is to recover the set of points (hyperbolic embeddings) or some other set of points with the same pairwise distances.


# Usage Example
For hierarchical data, hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting approach to learning low-dimensional embeddings while preserving rich structural information owing to the exponential growth in volume with respect to its radius. Whereas, the growth is only polinomial in Euclidean geometry.

Let us consider the following example: "Mary married john who works at the bakery"
The constituency tree (hierarchical structure) of this sentence is shown bellow

  <img src="assets/constituency_tree.png" alt="Constituency tree of the sentence 'Mary Married john who works at the bakery'" width="400"/>
</p>

The following code snippet recovers the hyperbolic embeddings $X_rec$ of each word given the pairwise distance between all words in the sentence $A$, which represents the shortest paths in the constituency tree.

```python
import numpy as np
from hMDS.embedding import hmds, poincare_dist
from hMDS.utils import distortion

# Original distance matrix
A = np.array([
              [0.,  6,  8,  9,  10, 11, 12, 12], 
              [6.,  0,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10, 10],
              [8.,  6,  0,  7,  8,  9,  10, 10],
              [9.,  7,  7,  0,  7,  8,  9,  9],
              [10,  8,  8,  7,  0,  5,  6,  6],
              [11,  9,  9,  8,  5,  0,  5,  5],
              [12, 10, 10,  9,  6,  5,  0,  4],
              [12, 10, 10,  9,  6,  5,  4,  0],
            ])
# Run hMDS
scale = 1
Xrec = hmds(A, k=8, scale=scale)

print(f">> Embeddings in the PoincarÃ© Ball of dimension = {Xrec.shape[1]}")

# Compute the reconstructed distance matrix
n = A.shape[0]
Hrec = np.zeros_like(A)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        Hrec[i,j] = poincare_dist(Xrec[i], Xrec[j])/scale

print(">> Recovered pairwise distances:")
print(np.round(Hrec, 2))

# Evaluate the distortion
dist = distortion(A, Hrec, n=8)
print(f'>> Average distortion = {np.round(dist["avg_distortion"], 2)}, best average distortion is 0.')
print(f'>> Worst-case distortion = {np.round(dist["wc_distortion"], 2)}, best worst-case distortion is 1.')
```
